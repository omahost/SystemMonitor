Original Task:
1) Task description:
Write a windows desktop application that checks devices connected via ports (ethernet, usb), display parameters, statuses (on / off, error, at work).

2) Was implemented:
- getting USB and Printer devices connected via ports (ethernet, usb)

- displaying basic information for devices (Device ID, Description etc)

- displaying statuses like (on / off, error, at work).
Note: was not tested/implemented all scenarios (handling and mapping custom device status into our type).
Note: Main purpose of code and implementation was to show how are used design patterns and architecture layers.

- event detection for inserting/removing devices, so inserting new devices will automatically appear in list.

- architecture/foundation is made flexible, so it will be easier to add other kind of devices to analyze

3) Left to implement:
- unit tests for main parts and classes of application
- event handling for device property change, to auto update item in grid
